MODULE 9: INCREMENTAL DATA LOADING WITH AUTO LOADER 

★How does Auto Loader work:--

Auto Loader automatically detects new files arriving in cloud storage.
It processes files incrementally, avoiding reprocessing of old files.
Supports streaming or micro-batch ingestion.

★Incremental ingestion:-----

Only new or changed data is loaded.
Checkpoints keep track of processed files.
Saves time and compute resources.

★Configuring Auto Loader to read new files:-----

Use .readStream.format("cloudFiles") in Databricks.
Specify the file format (csv, json, parquet) using cloudFiles.format.

Example:

df = spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles") \
      .option("cloudFiles.format", "csv") \
      .option("cloudFiles.inferColumnTypes", "true") \
      .load("/mnt/data/patient_claims/")


★Write the data incrementally into a Delta table:----

Use .writeStream.format("delta") to append new data to a Delta table.
Provide a checkpoint location to track progress.
Example:

df.writeStream.format("delta") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/checkpoints/patient_claims/") \
    .outputMode("append") \
    .table("patient_claims_delta")
	
★Summary / Flow
Files arrive in cloud storage → Auto Loader detects new files → Reads as stream → Appends to Delta table → Checkpoint ensures no duplicates.

MODULE_10 DATABRICKS WORKFLOWS:---
🔹 Databricks Jobs – Key Features

★ Creating a Job

A job in Databricks is a task or workflow that runs notebooks, scripts, or queries.
Example: ETL pipeline to clean patient data daily.

★ Viewing Jobs and Job Details

Check job’s configuration, runs, owner, and cluster type.
Helps track who scheduled it, when it runs, and what it triggers.

★ Running Your First Job

Jobs can be run manually (on-demand) or automatically (scheduled).
Example: Run a PySpark notebook to process CSV files in GCS.

★ Scheduling Jobs

Schedule jobs to run at fixed intervals (hourly, daily, weekly).
Example: Load patient claims data every night at 1 AM.

★ Setting Parameters

Pass input parameters (file path, date, hospital ID).
Makes jobs reusable for different datasets without modifying code.

★ Viewing Completed Jobs

After execution, view status (success/failure), logs, and execution time.
Useful for debugging failed runs.

★ Managing Dependencies

Define jobs that run in sequence (multi-task jobs).

Example:

Ingest hospital data
Clean and transform data
Load into BigQuery

★ Setting up Alerts

Configure email/Slack alerts for failures or delays.

Critical in healthcare → ensures compliance pipelines don’t silently fail.
