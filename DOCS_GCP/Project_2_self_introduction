PROJECT -2  :

My name is "Srikanth reddy", 
i have completed my MCA from "Newtons institute of engineering college" in 2020  
i have total "4.1" years of It experience.
from last "2.5" years i have been working in google cloud projects  as a data engineer.

▶️“Coming to my Skills:=================================
“My skills are Python and SQL, BigQuery, building ETL pipelines with Airflow/Cloud Composer, and working on GCP services like GCS, Dataflow, and Pub/Sub. I also use PySpark and SQL to perform data transformations such as filtering, joins, aggregations, and data cleaning before loading data into BigQuery.”
(OR)

Programming: Python (for data pipelines, scripting, and automation).
SQL: Strong in writing complex queries, optimizing performance in BigQuery / Teradata.
Data Warehousing: Experience with BigQuery (and some exposure to Teradata).
ETL / Orchestration: Creating data pipelines using Airflow / Cloud Composer by writing DAGs for ingestion, transformation, and loading. ✅
Cloud Platforms: Hands-on with Google Cloud (GCS, BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub).
Data Transformation: Using PySpark and SQL, and BigQuery for cleaning and processing data.

▶️I have worked as a Data Engineer on a BigQuery Data Lake project, where we get the data from multiple data sources such as SQL server, mysql and sometimes csv, Json, parquet in gcs. 

we extract the data from source using DataProc(pyspark)/dataflow(Apache beam python),
On top this data are also performing transformations(such as duplicate removal,
null handling, column naming, aggregations, joining, merging) and finally loading it into BigQuery as raw tables. 

“Based on business requirements, we perform data analysis and create insight tables in BigQuery, which are then used by the business team for reporting and decision-making.” (or) “Business team uses it for reports, 
“These insight tables are very useful for downstream processes, as they are used to create dashboards and reports in BI tools.”

“We use Cloud Composer to schedule and manage our data pipelines, with retries and alerts for reliability. It keeps our BigQuery tables refreshed and ensures smooth end-to-end workflows.”
“That’s all about my project.”
