▶️Example: Ride-Hailing App (like Uber/Ola)

1. Publisher 🚕

When a customer books a ride, the app publishes a message:

{
  "ride_id": "R123",
  "user_id": "U456",
  "pickup": "Bangalore",
  "drop": "Airport",
  "time": "2025-09-19T10:30:00Z"
}


2. Topic 🎯

The message goes into a Pub/Sub topic called "rides-topic".

3. Subscribers 👇

Billing service → subscribes to "rides-topic" and processes the payment.
Driver-matching service → subscribes and assigns a driver.
Analytics pipeline (Dataflow → BigQuery) → subscribes and stores ride data for reporting.

✅ So, one published event → multiple subscribers handle it independently.

⚡ Interview one-liner:

“For example, in a ride-hailing app, when a ride is booked, the app publishes the event to a Pub/Sub topic. Different subscribers like billing, driver assignment, and analytics pipelines receive the same message in real time.”
