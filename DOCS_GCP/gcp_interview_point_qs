🛑What is GCS ?  
Google Cloud Storage, is a fully managed object storage service from GCP.
It’s used to store any type of file—structured or unstructured—like CSV, JSON, videos, images, etc."
it is a pay-as-you-go model.
We don’t have to worry about infrastructure, like scaling, or backups, Google handles the everything.
In GCS, everything is stored as objects inside buckets. A bucket is like a folder or container where you organize and manage your data.

What is GCS ?  
fully managed (no infra headache) 
a service for storing :  
any type of data,  
any amount of data,  
any number of files 
===============================================================================
🛑What are the storage classes in GCP Cloud Storage?
1)Standard Storage → For frequently accessed data (hot data).Example: Real-time apps, websites.
2)Nearline Storage → For data accessed once a month.Example: Backups, disaster recovery.
3)Coldline Storage → For data accessed once a quarter (very infrequent).Example: Archival with occasional access.
4)Archive Storage → For data accessed once a year or less (long-term archival).Example: Compliance records, medical/legal data.

✅ Explanation: How to Create a GCS Bucket (in Console)
1 Go to GCS Console
Open https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser

2 Click “Create bucket”

3 Give a globally unique bucket name
  Example: my_bkt_name9640
  Bucket names must be unique across all of Google Cloud.
  
4 Choose the Location Type and Location
  Location type: Regional or Multi-region
  Location: For example, us-central1, asia-south1, etc.
  
5 Choose a Storage Class
  Options: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, or Archive
  Example: Select Standard (commonly used)
  
6 Set Access Control
  Choose Uniform (recommended for most cases)
  Or choose Fine-grained if you want object-level permissions
  
7 (Optional) Configure:
  Encryption
  Retention policies
  Labels
  
8 Click “Create”
 ✅ Your bucket is now ready to use!

What is Composer? 
Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service in Google Cloud.
It is based /built on Apache Airflow (an open-source platform) designed for  

✅Creating:-You write a Python script called a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph),In that script, you list tasks (like load data, run query, send email) and their order.
✅Scheduling :-	Set daily, hourly, or custom execution schedules
✅Managing   :-	No need to install or manage Airflow servers yourself
✅Monitoring complex workflows:--Get logs, retry failed tasks, set alerts

✅ Common use cases for Cloud Composer include:---  
Data processing pipelines, scheduling 
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows,  
Automation of routine tasks. 
Infrastructure Automation

✅COMMON TRANSFORMATION OPERATIONS:----------------------------
1. Filtering
▶️Keep only relevant rows.
▶️Example: Only employees with salary > 50,000

2. Renaming Columns
▶️Make names cleaner or standard.
▶️Example: emp_id → employee_id

3. Changing Data Types
▶️Convert a string date to actual date format.
▶️Example: "2025-08-01" → DateType

4. Aggregations
▶️Sum, average, count, max, min
▶️Example: Total sales per region

5. Joining Data
▶️Combine multiple datasets
▶️Example: Join employee table with department table

6. Dropping Nulls / Filling Defaults
▶️Remove bad records or fill with defaults
▶️Example: Replace null city with "Unknown"

7. Adding Calculated Columns
▶️Derive new columns from existing ones
▶️Example: age = current_date - date_of_birth

8. Removing Duplicates
▶️Keep only unique records
