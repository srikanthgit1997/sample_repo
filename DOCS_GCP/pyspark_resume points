Absolutely! You can summarize your Healthcare RCM Data Lake project in resume-friendly bullet points that highlight your skills, technologies, and impact. Here's a polished version:

• Designed and implemented a Data Lake for Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), centralizing data from multiple hospitals and insurance sources.
• Built ETL pipelines using PySpark and Dataproc to extract, transform, and load EMR and claims data into structured fact and dimension tables in BigQuery.
• Implemented Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) for layered data processing, ensuring clean, enriched, and business-ready datasets.
• Applied Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) to maintain historical changes in patient and transaction data.
• Developed metadata-driven ETL pipelines for scalable and dynamic workflow execution, reducing manual intervention.
• Integrated external healthcare datasets via APIs for CPT, ICD, and NPI codes, standardizing procedures, diagnoses, and provider information.
• Automated ETL orchestration using Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow) to manage dependencies and schedule pipelines.
• Implemented data quality and validation checks to handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.
• Leveraged CI/CD with GitHub and Cloud Build to enable automated deployment and version control for data pipelines.
• Configured logging, monitoring, and error handling to track pipeline performance and alert on failures.
• Ensured data security and compliance with HIPAA standards using IAM roles and access controls.
• Delivered analytics-ready gold tables in BigQuery to enable KPI dashboards, revenue analysis, and claims processing optimization.
