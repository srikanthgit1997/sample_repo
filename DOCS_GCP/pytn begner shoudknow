Important Python concepts that every beginner should know 

 1. Variables & Data Types 🧠
Variables are like boxes where you store stuff.
Python automatically knows the type of data you're working with!

name = "Alice"    # String  
age = 25             # Integer  
height = 5.6          # Float  
is_student = True  # Boolean

 2. Conditional Statements 🔀
Want your program to make decisions?
Use if, elif, and else!

if age > 18:  
    print("You're an adult!")  
else:  
    print("You're a kid!")

 3. Loops 🔁
Repeat tasks without writing them 100 times!

For loop – Loop over a sequence

While loop – Loop until a condition is false


for i in range(5):  
    print(i)  # 0 to 4  

count = 0  
while count < 3:  
    print("Hello")  
    count += 1

 4. Functions ⚙️
Reusable blocks of code. Keeps your program clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)!

def greet(name):  
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")  

greet("Bob")

 5. Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets 📦

List: Ordered, changeable

Tuple: Ordered, unchangeable

Dict: Key-value pairs

Set: Unordered, unique items


my_list = [1, 2, 3]  
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)  
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}  
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

 6. String Manipulation ✂️
Work with text like a pro!

text = "Python is awesome"  
print(text.upper())  # PYTHON IS AWESOME  
print(text.replace("awesome", "cool"))  # Python is cool

 7. Input from User ⌨️
Make your programs interactive!

name = input("Enter your name: ")  
print("Hello " + name)

 8. Error Handling ⚠️
Catch mistakes before they crash your program.

try:  
    x = 1 / 0  
except ZeroDivisionError:  
    print("You can't divide by zero!")

 9. File Handling 📁
Read or write files using Python.

with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:  
    content = file.read()  
    print(content)

 10. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🧱
Python lets you model real-world things using classes and objects.

class Dog:  
    def _init_(self, name):  
        self.name = name  

    def bark(self):  
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")  

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")  
my_dog.bark()
