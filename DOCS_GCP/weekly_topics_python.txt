========================================================
Today, Let's start with the first topic of the Python Learning Series:

Variables & Data Types:-----------------

1. What’s a Variable?

In Python, a variable is like a container where you store values. You don’t need to declare the type of the variable — you simply assign a value to it, and Python automatically figures out what type it is.

Example:

name = "Alice"  # Here 'name' is a variable, and "Alice" is a string value.

age = 25        # 'age' is an integer.

is_active = True  # 'is_active' is a boolean (True/False).


2. Python is Dynamically Typed

You don’t need to tell Python what type of value the variable will hold. The type is decided automatically when you assign the value. You can even change the type of a variable at any time.

Example:

x = 10      # Initially, x is an integer.

x = "Ten"   # Now, x is a string.

3. Common Data Types in Python

Here are the basic types of data that variables can store in Python:

- int: Whole numbers (e.g., age = 30)

- float: Decimal numbers (e.g., price = 19.99)

- str: Strings, or text (e.g., name = "John")

- bool: Boolean values, which are either True or False (e.g., is_active = True)

- list: Ordered collection of items (e.g., fruits = ["apple", "banana"])

- tuple: Ordered collection of items that cannot be changed (e.g., coords = (10, 20))

- dict: Collection of key-value pairs (e.g., person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25})

- set: Collection of unique, unordered items (e.g., numbers = {1, 2, 3})


4. Type Checking

You can use the type() function to check what type a variable holds.

Example:

x = 3.14
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'float'>


5. Variable Naming

Some rules to follow when naming variables:

- Start with a letter or an underscore (not a number).

- No spaces allowed in variable names.

- Use descriptive names (e.g., user_age is better than x).


That’s it for Variables & Data Types! 
==========================================
Now, Let’s dive into the next important topic in the Python Learning Series 

Operators & Expressions:-----------

In Python, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They help us build expressions, which are combinations of values and operators that Python evaluates to produce another value.

Let’s break down the main types of operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform basic math:

a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)  # Addition => 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction => 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication => 30
print(a / b)  # Division => 3.333...
print(a % b)  # Modulus (remainder) => 1
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation => 1000
print(a // b) # Floor division => 3


2. Comparison Operators

Used to compare values and return True or False:

print(a == b)  # Equal to => False
print(a != b)  # Not equal to => True
print(a > b)   # Greater than => True
print(a < b)   # Less than => False
print(a >= b)  # Greater than or equal => True
print(a <= b)  # Less than or equal => False

3. Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions:

x = True
y = False

print(x and y)  # False
print(x or y)   # True
print(not x)    # False


4. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values and perform operations in one step:

x = 5
x += 2  # Same as x = x + 2 => 7
x *= 3  # Now x = x * 3 => 21


5. Membership Operators

Used to check if a value is in a sequence:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(2 in my_list)     # True
print(5 not in my_list) # True


Expressions in Python always return a value.

Example:

result = (5 + 3) * 2
print(result)  # Output: 16
=======================================
Let's move to the next important topic in the Python Learning Series

Strings in Python:----------------------

A string is simply a sequence of characters, enclosed in either single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ".

Example:

name = "John"
city = 'New York'


How to create multi-line strings?

Use triple quotes:

message = '''Hello,
Welcome to Python!'''


Common String Operations:

1. Accessing Characters

Strings are like lists of characters — you can use indexing:

text = "Python"
print(text[0])  # Output: 'P'
print(text[-1]) # Output: 'n' (last character)


2. String Slicing

You can grab parts (slices) of a string:

text = "Python"
print(text[0:2])  # Output: 'Py'
print(text[2:])   # Output: 'thon'
print(text[:4])   # Output: 'Pyth'

Tip: text[start:end] grabs characters from start to end-1.


3. String Methods

Python gives lots of helpful functions to work with strings:

name = "john doe"

print(name.upper())    # JOHN DOE

print(name.capitalize()) # John doe

print(name.replace("john", "jane")) # jane doe

print(name.split())    # ['john', 'doe']

print(name.find("doe")) # 5 (index where 'doe' starts)


4. String Formatting

Old way (not recommended now):

age = 25
print("I am %d years old" % age)


Modern way (recommended):

name = "John"
age = 25

print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

or

print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))


5. Strings are Immutable

You cannot change a string once created. You can only create a new one.

Example:

text = "hello"
# text[0] = 'H'   ❌ Error! Strings cannot be modified.

new_text = "H" + text[1:]
print(new_text)   # Hello
Important: Always remember strings are zero-indexed and immutable.
==========================================================================
Now, let’s move to the next topic in the Python Learning Series 

Lists in Python

Imagine you have a basket where you can put apples, bananas, and even a notebook — all mixed together. In Python, that basket is called a List.

A list in Python is an ordered collection that can hold a mix of items — numbers, strings, even other lists!

Example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]


Key Properties:

- Lists are ordered: Items have a fixed position.

- Lists are mutable: You can change them after creation.

- Lists can contain duplicate items.


Creating a List:

Just put your items inside square brackets [], separated by commas:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.5, True]


Accessing Items:

Python starts counting from 0.
So the first item is at position 0, the second item at 1, and so on.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])   # apple
print(fruits[1])   # banana
print(fruits[2])  # cherry

If you want the last item, use a negative index:

print(fruits[-1])  # cherry

(-1 means last item, -2 means second last, and so on.)

List Slicing:

You can slice a list to get multiple items:

It picks from start index to one before end index.

So 0:2 means item at index 0 and 1, but not 2.

print(fruits[0:2])  # ['apple', 'banana']

print(fruits[1:])   # ['banana', 'cherry']


Modifying Lists:

Lists are mutable — that means you can change them after creating!

fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']


Adding Items:

Append adds at the end:

fruits.append("orange")   # Adds at the end


Insert adds at a specific position:

fruits.insert(1, "kiwi")  # Inserts at index 1


Removing Items:

Remove deletes by value:

fruits.remove("apple")    # Removes first occurrence


Pop deletes by position (default is last item):

fruits.pop()          # Removes last item


Useful List Methods:

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]

print(len(numbers))    # 5
print(min(numbers))    # 1
print(max(numbers))    # 5
numbers.sort()         # [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.reverse()      # [5, 4, 3, 1, 1]


List Comprehension (Shortcut to create lists):

Instead of writing a loop to create a list, you can do it in one line!


Example: Creating squares of numbers from 0 to 4:

squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

It’s a clean, fast way to create new lists.

Important:
- Lists are mutable, so methods like append(), remove(), sort() change the list itself — they don’t return a new list.
- Lists are ordered — they remember the order you put things in.
